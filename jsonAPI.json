Considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, it is the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima, who directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A reworked version was released for the Famicom a few months later, which saw a release in North America for the NES the following year, although this version featured drastically altered level designs among other changes, and was developed without Kojima's involvement. A more faithful port of the MSX2 version was later included in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2, as well as in the HD Edition of the same game released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Vita, with these newer ports featuring a revised translation and additional gameplay features.\nThe game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world."}79582ed0a46496ad34f65c7099d7e5.jpg"},{"id":571,"name":"3D","slug":"3d","language":"eng","games_count":49571,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/74c/74c68a8de3d4983ff932dd456ac2dc66.jpg"},{"id":1309,"name":"hero","slug":"hero","language":"eng","games_count":4275,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/087/08727beb32c364d30e8b2a1aa8595f8e.jpg"},{"id":499,"name":"Team","slug":"team","language":"eng","games_count":22,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4ea/4ea507ceebeabb43edbc09468f5aaac6.jpg"}],"publishers":[{"id":10830,"name":"Activision Blizzard","slug":"activision-blizzard","games_count":706,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0c5/0c5fcdf04048200da14b90e0e6cfaf6b.jpg"},{"id":11237,"name":"Blizzard Entertainment","slug":"blizzard-entertainment","games_count":39,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b3b/b3b509310a178eaad9553a6e60f5bf94.jpg"}],"esrb_rating":{"id":3,"name":"Teen","slug":"teen"},"clip":null,"description_raw":"###The Legacy\nOverwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.\n\n###The story and setting\nAnyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.\n\n###Continuous support\nThe game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins."}ia/screenshots/8c5/8c549bf8351d44fe0fc9d5e522b4a08b.jpeg"},{"id":177,"name":"Voxel","slug":"voxel","language":"eng","games_count":1849,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c028c08838e981be9add1ef29c34cfaf.jpg"}],"publishers":[{"id":9959,"name":"Pipliz","slug":"pipliz","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f52cf974a97b673c6dd46b2e88db813.jpg"}],"esrb_rating":null,"clip":null,"description_raw":"Build your own village, castle or city and populate it with colonists!

The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There's an option to shift to the first or the third person view.\nMinecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.\nMinecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist."}
