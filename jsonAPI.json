The world of the game is open, infinitely wide, and procedurally generated. It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There's an option to shift to the first or the third person view.\nMinecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.\nMinecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist."}
