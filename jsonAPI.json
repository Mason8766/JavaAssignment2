Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.\n\n###Continuous support\nThe game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins."}language":"eng","games_count":4513,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a39/a392d867d88f20448ddcdce099ae07ee.jpg"},{"id":107,"name":"Family Friendly","slug":"family-friendly","language":"eng","games_count":2799,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d03/d030347839f74454afcd1008248b08ae.jpg"},{"id":192,"name":"Mature","slug":"mature","language":"eng","games_count":1146,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/be0/be084b850302abe81675bc4ffc08a0d0.jpg"},{"id":37797,"name":"true exclusive","slug":"true-exclusive","language":"eng","games_count":3996,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f585fa72f534f62f9e5da051179f5de.jpg"},{"id":148,"name":"Dark Humor","slug":"dark-humor","language":"eng","games_count":1788,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/8910274c8fe4ae2a5808ca4c31b4640e.jpg"},{"id":153,"name":"Satire","slug":"satire","language":"eng","games_count":860,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d03/d030347839f74454afcd1008248b08ae.jpg"}],"publishers":[{"id":4099,"name":"Running With Scissors","slug":"running-with-scissors","games_count":8,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/677/6779cdd190db9ae6995d05e5dae435ca.jpg"}],"esrb_rating":{"id":5,"name":"Adults Only","slug":"adults-only"},"clip":null,"description_raw":"Like original Postal, its sequel was specifically intended to spark controversy. The game is full of gross violence, black humor, obscenities, and biting satire of American life. The plot follows Postal Dude, a typical \"white trash\" and a small town trailer-park dweller, as he is given menial daily tasks, such as buying milk. The way he completes them, however, is what makes Postal 2 one of the most censored and offensive games ever. At the various points of the game, the player may piss over his opponents, use cats as gun silencers (by literally showing your gun up the cat's anus), burn dogs alive, blow up cars (but not drive them, in Postal 2 cars are simply four-wheeled explosives), shoot people and flip them a bird. The game, however, is just as violent as the player wants it to be. Most missions can be accomplished without killing, though it would have spoiled all the fun.\nThe gameplay has changed since the previous part. Isometric view from the original was replaced with the first-person view. The world around Postal Dude is living by itself, regardless of the player’s presence, much like in Grand Theft Auto series. All the town inhabitants are programmed to walk, chat and even fight each other as if they were real people."}d","slug":"vr-mod","language":"eng","games_count":17,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/645/64578c2a6daa30995692525172fd13ef.jpg"},{"id":43574,"name":"open-world","slug":"open-world-2","language":"eng","games_count":8,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b7d/b7d3f1715fa8381a4e780173a197a615.jpg"},{"id":4441,"name":"cube","slug":"cube","language":"eng","games_count":1817,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9e8c75c028188ba6ed8d6b95ff19c17_LhGq5iM.jpg"},{"id":1372,"name":"procedural-generation","slug":"procedural-generation-2","language":"eng","games_count":41,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfd/bfd5f710aa2e85cefdcc2497587d1401.jpg"},{"id":14973,"name":"modding","slug":"modding","language":"eng","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/0743ee3da83824640bab263876fb26ba.jpg"}],"publishers":[{"id":20987,"name":"Microsoft Studios","slug":"microsoft-studios","games_count":460,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/718/71891d2484a592d871e91dc826707e1c.jpg"},{"id":6271,"name":"Mojang","slug":"mojang","games_count":6,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/424/4242e76b898c47219406b83b49e40287.jpg"}],"esrb_rating":{"id":2,"name":"Everyone 10+","slug":"everyone-10-plus"},"clip":null,"description_raw":"One of the most popular games of the 2010s, Minecraft allows you to rebuild the environment around you. The world of the game is open, infinitely wide, and procedurally generated. It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There's an option to shift to the first or the third person view.\nMinecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.\nMinecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist."}
